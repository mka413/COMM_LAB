MAS
The project was about a tribe in Africa called “Masaai” , I wanted to showcase their tradition by viewing their traditional “Masaai dance” ritual.
The project was focused on gradient colors which I selected from a site called https://uigradients.com , they have various different colors to choose from. The second thing I focused on was adjusting the mobile menu of the website by adding a column menu when changing the website page size.  I watched many youtube videos that taught me how to do the line of code and allowed me to add a mobile menu using java, CSS, and HTML. The process was very difficult to execute I had to re-write the codes various times because of the errors, I am satisfied with the final website as it is my first time in the process of coding, I would have been happier with the website if I added actual contact us tabs. Also, one thing I added by CSS was when I hover on the menu options above the color fades from white to red, using the code .navbar__links: hover { color: crimson;  transition: all 0.3s ease;} . Overall this experience has been informational and made me more interested in coding
